# Given two numbers a and b, you need to swap their values so a holds the value of b and b holds the value of a. Just write the code to swap values of a and b at the specified place. The input and output are done automatically.

class Solution:
    def utility(self, a, b):
        #code here
        a,b = b,a
        print(a,b)
